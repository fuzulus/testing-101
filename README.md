This repository contains code for a workshop on subject of "Testing 101".
It contains various examples of:

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Functional tests

## Prerequisites

1. An IDE (e.g. PhpStorm, VS Code, etc.)
2. Docker

## Software used - 2023-02-14

1. Docker Desktop 4.15.0 (93002)
2. Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
3. PhpStorm 2022.3.1, Build #PS-223.8214.64, built on December 22, 2022

## Setup

1. `git clone git@github.com:fuzulus/testing-101.git`
2. Run `sh scripts/setup.sh` from the root of the repository. This script will:
   1. Setup Docker environment
   2. Setup Docker override
   3. Run Docker compose up
   4. Install all PHP dependencies via Composer
3. SSH into the PHP container to run all the below available commands: `docker compose exec php bash` or `docker compose exec php sh`

## Project description

The project is consisted of a small API for management of a [Pokémon Pokédex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex).

The Pokémon data is currently inside `src/Infrastructure/Driven/Persistence/Doctrine/Fixtures/Data/pokemon.json` to focus more on the testing rather than data collection.
In the future, a 3rd party API like [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), might be used to expand the functionalities and tests.

### Directory structure

The directory structure is based on a combination of ([read for reference](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/)):

* hexagonal architecture 
* onion architecture 
* Domain-Driven Design
* Command Query Responsibility Segregation

It does not influence the testing in any way other than giving a clearer picture what should be tested with which type or level of test.

## Tests

This section describes the types of tests covered in the project, their goals and covered targets.
All types of tests have two commands: the Test command and the Coverage command.

The Test command runs all the tests inside a single testsuite.

The Coverage command runs all the tests inside a single testsuite and generates a coverage report.

Available test suites are:

* Unit
* Integration
* Functional

**NOTICE** 

It is recommended to run all the commands inside the PHP Docker container provided.
The container is equipped with all the dependencies necessary to execute the commands. 

### Unit

#### Test command

```shell
composer test:unit
```

#### Coverage command: 

```shell
composer test:coverage:unit
```

The Unit test suite covers mostly the Domain folder. It is a showcase of examples on how to test: entities, value objects, utility services, etc.
The Unit test suite uses mocks for various service dependencies and therefor does not test the integration of the services with the infrastructural layer (e.g. connection to the database).

### Integration

The Integration test suite covers mostly the Application folder. It showcases examples of testing: application level services, command/query handlers, etc.
The Integration test suite does not use mocks (unless connecting to a 3rd party API). It uses all the infrastructure services available to test their integration and cooperation. 

#### Test command

```shell
composer test:integration
```

#### Coverage command:

```shell
composer test:coverage:integration
```

### Functional

#### Test command

```shell
composer test:functional
```

#### Coverage command:

```shell
composer test:coverage:functional
```

The Functional test suite covers mostly the Infrastructure folder. It showcases examples of testing endpoints - the main entrance points to our application.
The Functional test suite does not use mocks (unless connecting to a 3rd party API). It uses all the infrastructure services available to validate that for a given input the endpoint will return an expected output.
